# critical-errors syntax-fix jsx-broken
CRITICAL SYNTAX ERRORS - Need Immediate Fix:

1. app/layout.tsx ✅ FIXED - Removed weight 700 from Share Tech Mono (only 400 available)

2. components/HeaderPlanBuild.tsx - Line 143: Duplicate "{isPaused ? (" statement
   - File appears to have OLD code (no cyberpunk updates applied yet)
   - Need to check current state and fix

3. components/ClaudeLayout.tsx - Line 263: JSX structure broken "Expected '</', got '{'"
   - Unclosed component or wrong closing tag
   - Need to identify the component with incorrect closing

4. components/ChatPanel.tsx - Line 185: JSX structure broken
   - Similar issue - unclosed component

5. components/FileExplorer.tsx - Line 550: Multiple JSX issues
   - "Expected '</', got 'jsx text'"
   - Possibly unclosed div or component

6. components/WorkspacePanel.tsx - Line 481: ">" character needs escaping
   - Use {'>'} or &gt; instead of raw >

7. components/ui/tooltip.tsx - Missing dependency @radix-ui/react-tooltip
   - Need to install: npm install @radix-ui/react-tooltip

ROOT CAUSE: My batch edits using str_replace created malformed JSX due to string matching issues.
SOLUTION: Need to view each file, identify exact broken sections, and fix with precise edits.
